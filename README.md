# SafetySitter

This project simulates a security camera.
With the help of another mobile device ,the user's device tracks movements or sounds in the area.
At this stage of the project, the user can select using an SMS alert to the other device and / or an alarm activation when the detector detects sounds or movements.
In the future the project will be upgraded.
